          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a dedicated and friendly tutor who genuinely enjoys helping students grow in
            confidence and reach their academic potential. I graduated from Our Lady of Mercy
            College, Parramatta in 2024 with an ATAR of 98.55, and I am currently studying Medicine
            at Western Sydney University.
          </p>
          <p>
            As someone who has navigated the demands of high school and competitive examinations, I
            understand how challenging and overwhelming study can feel at times. I aim to create a
            supportive and encouraging learning environment where students feel comfortable asking
            questions, making mistakes, and building understanding at their own pace. I am patient,
            organised, and highly motivated, and I take pride in forming positive relationships
            with my students, so they feel supported both academically and personally throughout
            their learning journey.

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
              I have over three years of tutoring experience, supporting students across a wide
              range of academic levels, abilities, and goals. I have spent two years tutoring high
              school students in both one-on-one and small group settings, with a strong focus on
              addressing gaps in understanding, strengthening foundational skills, and helping
              students build confidence in their learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to high school tutoring, I also tutor students at medical school level,
              providing academic support in a demanding and high-pressure learning environment.
              This experience has further strengthened my ability to explain complex concepts
              clearly, adapt to different learning styles, and support students with effective
              study strategies and time management.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have worked with students through several private tutoring companies, and many of
              my current and past students have demonstrated significant improvements in grades,
              academic confidence, and overall performance. Parents and students consistently
              report clearer understanding, stronger exam technique, and improved results over time. Student and parent
              reviews are available upon request.
